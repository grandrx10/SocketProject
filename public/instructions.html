<h1>UPDATE: BALANCE PATCH 2.1 </h1>

<h2>Tank:</h2>
<p>New Passive: Size and health increase per kill. Tank now infinitely scales.</p>
<p>Nerfed Tank healing at no kills. Healing is now based off of max health instead of flat numbers.</p>

<h2>Watcher:</h2>
<p>Decreased J cooldown. Watcher's J felt unneccesarily slow to fire. We will keep an eye out and nerf if it is too
    strong.</p>

<h2>Mercenary:</h2>
<p>Trap cooldown decreased. The trap is mercenary's primary setup tool. He seems a bit weak right now, so we will give
    him the ability to use it more often.</p>

<h2>Reverdant:</h2>
<p>Increased J bullet speed. After the previous instant kill nerfs, Reverdant seems a bit weak, so we buffed him.</p>

<h2>Doc:</h2>
<p>Doctor has a 0% play rate and so we decided to buff him. Increased damage on J and K as well as healing from J.</p>
<p>Decreased coolodwn for Doctor's J.</p>

<h2>Deadeye:</h2>
<p>Reload cooldown decreased. He felt like he was running out of bullets too of</p>
<p>Nerfed Tank healing at no kills. Healing is now based off of max health instead of flat numbers.</p>

<h2>Necromancer:</h2>
<p>Decreased cooldown of L (Minion spawn time)</p>
<p>Spawning minions is the core of Necromancer's kit. Increasing this should make him better.</p>

<h2>Samurai</h2>
<p>Increased Ultimate cooldown. Decreased the amount of time the Ultimate cage is up for.</p>

<h2>Captain</h2>
<p>Increased J damage and healing. Increased K damage. This should give him enough firepower to take out other classes.</p>
